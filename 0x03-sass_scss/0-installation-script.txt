Steps I took to install SASS:

1. Created a new directory called 0x03-sass_scss inside alx-intermediate-frontend repository.
2. Installed Node.js version 20.16 (using nvm on Ubuntu) [Optional for Windows].
3. Installed SASS using npm with version 3.7.4:
   npm install sass -v 3.7.4
4. Verified installation by running:
   sass --version
